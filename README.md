# tictactoe

This is mainly a prototype for my own experience.  Eventually I want to build this into 
a one-person game and have the computer be smart enough to play a human.  First is to 
do the game in jQuery, and once I have the logic part done, I'd like to rewrite the game
in React.  I'd like to have a backend that computes the logic for each move.
